  <h2 align="center"> Geometry </h2>

The <i>Geometry</i> playground focuses on the geometrical shape and structure of objects, as well as interactivity; wireframe is used for several animations to provide a more three-dimensional experience, as you can see in the first animation below.<br />Interaction with objects occurs through typical events such as click or mouseover (as in the second animation below), as well as with slider controls.

 <br />
 
The <i>Aesthetics</i> playground offers pure bliss in the form of impressive animations and vaporwave color gradients.<br />

This very simple game inspired by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADBnmJ1Z_18&ab_channel=CodeWorkshop"> following tutorial </a> is a minor videoludic addition to add a more dynamic component to an otherwise relaxed atmosphere.
I mainly used it to learn about the Recoil library and understand how I may implement state management for future videogame projects.

<i>Meditation Field</i> is the centerpiece of the project, the point where all the elements of geometry, aesthetics and interaction come together.<br />
It is inspired by the concept of mindfulness: the user should focus intensely on the wireframe sphere at the center of the screen while being mindful of the existence of the multitude of swirling torus knots around it. The latter represent the myriad of thoughts the crowd our minds and obfuscate our thinking with regard to the essential (the sphere). <br /> By clicking on a torus know, the mindful user selects an element of their cognition to be inspected or simply to be activated in their thinking. At the same time, the thought represented by the torus know remains merely a floating item, rather than a heavy weight on the users's consciousness.<br />
When the user is done with their inspection, they can click on the item again and thus de-select it. The items continues to to float and swirl as it did before.
Our thoughts never truly leave us, but leave our focus if we want them to.
